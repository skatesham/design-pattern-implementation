# Facade

Facade. Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.


    Facade: Delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem classes.
    Subsystem classes: Implements subsystem functionalities. Subsystem classes are used by the facade, but not the other way around. We will come to it later in this post.
    Client: Requests the facade to perform some action.
